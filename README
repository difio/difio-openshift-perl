App-Monupco-OpenShift
=====================

monupco.com registration agent for OpenShift / Perl applications

This module compiles a list of locally installed Perl distributions and sends it to
http://monupco.com where you check your application statistics and available updates.

INSTALLATION

To register your OpenShift Perl application to Monupco do the following:

1) Create a Perl application on OpenShift:

    rhc-create-app -a myapp -t perl-5.10

2) Add a dependency in your deplist.txt file

    cd ./myapp/
    echo "App::Monupco::OpenShift" >> deplist.txt

3) Set your userID in the ./data/MONUPCO_SETTINGS file

    echo "export MONUPCO_USER_ID=YourUserID"  > ./data/MONUPCO_SETTINGS

4) Enable the registration script in .openshift/action_hooks/post_deploy

    source $OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR/data/MONUPCO_SETTINGS
    export PERL5LIB=$OPENSHIFT_GEAR_DIR/perl5lib/lib/perl5/
    $OPENSHIFT_GEAR_DIR/perl5lib/lib/perl5/App/Monupco/OpenShift.pm

5) Commit your changes

        git add .
        git commit -m "enable monupco registration"

6) Then push your application to OpenShift

    git push

That's it, you can now check your application statistics at
<http://monupco.com>
